5. Add commit lint `pnpm add --save-dev @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}`
6. Echo config `echo "export default { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };" > commitlint.config.js`
7. Add commit lint rules and guidance to claude config. `We will be using commitlint as we work on this project. As we create each microfrontend we will need to add it to the scopes for commit lint config. Lets add vibe as one of the valid scopes.`
8. Claude asked to add husky, allowed it to do so.
