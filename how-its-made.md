3. `claude`
4. Inside claude terminal ui `/init`
5. Add commit lint `pnpm add --save-dev @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}`
6. Echo config `echo "export default { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };" > commitlint.config.js`
7. Add commit lint rules and guidance to claude config. `We will be using commitlint as we work on this project. As we create each microfrontend we will need to add it to the scopes for commit lint config. Lets add vibe as one of the valid scopes.`
8. Claude asked to add husky, allowed it to do so. 
9. Ask Claude to add the new remotes `We are going to be creating a clone of the popular social media platform X. As we do so we will be leveraging micro frontends. vibe is going to be our main host application and will serve as our app shell. We will need to create 3 additional remotes. The remotes are feed, grok, and create. We will use the nx generate command nx generate @nx/react:app apps/{remoteName}. All of the remotes should use rspack as their bundler.`
```bash
⏺ Great! I've successfully set up the microfrontend architecture for your X clone with:

  1. Created three remote applications using Nx:
    - feed: For displaying content
    - grok: For AI capabilities
    - create: For post creation
  2. Updated the commitlint configuration to include all the microfrontends as valid scopes
  3. Updated the CLAUDE.md file with:
    - Project architecture information
    - Build commands for all microfrontends
    - Updated commit guidelines

  The project structure is now set up with a host app (vibe) and three remote microfrontends (feed, grok, create), all configured with the rspack bundler.

  Would you like me to commit these changes or set up Module Federation to connect the host and remotes?
```
10. Realized that there was no "cross-cutting" scope, so manually added common to commitlint scopes.
11. Added Zephyr `pnpm add zephyr-rspack-plugin@latest`
12. Manually added zephyr to vibe rspack.config.js `const {withZephyr} = require('zephyr-rspack-plugin');` and `module.exports = withZephyr()({ /* existing config */ })` per [docs](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/recipes/react-rspack-nx)
13. Refactoring rspack configs with claude. `i do not like that the rspack configs are js, lets refactor all of them to ts `
14. While refactoring claude tried to do a build to verify the refactor, this was causing zephyr to authenticate and claude didn't open the window. Killed claude.
15. Saw Rspack versions were out of date, bumped to `^1.3.4`
16. ran `pnpm approve-builds` to enable swc and nx
17. Tried to do a build of vibe with `nx build vibe` got errors
```bash

```
28. Clearing Zephyr config `rm -r ~/.zephyr/` then building vibe again with `nx build vibe`
29. Output was still broken, had to run with `NX_DAEMON=false` again because auth hangs.
30. Running with output `DEBUG=zephyr:* NX_DAEMON=false nx build vibe`, output was unchanged, realized I may be hitting nx cache.
31. Running `DEBUG=zephyr:* NX_DAEMON=false nx build vibe --skip-nx-cache` got a full output, however couldn't see URL easily. Running without verbose output. 
32. `NX_DAEMON=false nx build vibe --skip-nx-cache`
33. This was still broken due to some issues with compatibility of Zephyr and the Nx config wrapper for Rspack, and the newer versions of Rspack. Moved to manual Rspack config.
34. Asked Claude to move these changes to the other Rspack configs. `I made some manual changes to the vibe/rspack.config.ts, help me apply these changes to the other rspack configs.`
35. There was some issues with the configuration that Claude generated, manually corrected these to be able to run the builds successfully.
36. Switched to v0 to create the initial UI. Used the following prompt with three screenshots of X, one of the whole screen, one of the page with Grok in the navigation, and one of the compose modal.
```markdown
I'm going to create a clone of X for a project. I want to use React and Shadcn. I want you to recreate the screenshots of X that I uploaded. I have requirements below:
- Must use React
- Must use Shadcn
- Must use typescript
- Must use Tanstack Router
- Must use Tanstack Query
- All data should be from json objects
- There should be a layout component that has the entire application shell that includes the navigation on the left side as well as an router outlet that is displaying the feed component when at root
- There should be a single component for the feed
- There should be a single component for the grok page that displays when at /grok
- There should be a create post modal that opens when clicking "Post" in the app shell, this modal should also change the route to /compose/post (without changing the content behind the modal)
```
37. It got an error saying a component could not be found. Asked it to fix it with v0. Did this four times, on the fourth attempt it removed tanstack router while trying to fix it. It still didn't work. Started again with a less complex requirements.
38. I took a screenshot of the X page and said to `recreate this UI with React and Shadcn` then used the "magic" icon to enhance the prompt and v0 gave me this `Develop a user interface (UI) using React and Shadcn. The UI should include the following components: a navigation bar with a logo and links, a main content area with a title and a brief description, a button, and a form with input fields for name, email, and a message, along with a submit button. The design should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Ensure the UI is visually appealing and follows modern design principles. The components should be styled using Shadcn's pre-built components and utilities.` the output was trash and didn't use the screenshot.
39. Tried a third time with the screenshot and this prompt. `Recreate this screenshot. The code should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. The components should be styled using Shadcn's pre-built components and utilities along with tailwind.`
40. This time it was a lot closer. I had it fix the hover colors in the left nav with a screen shot of what it "should" look like and "The hover states on the left nav are the wrong colors this is what they should be."
41. Asked it to fix the UI for the side panel as well. "The sections on the right side are also the wrong colors. Lets fix those next. This is what they should look like vs what you have. The one that is rgba(0,0,0,0.00) background is the correct one. Font color should be rgb(231, 233, 234) by default."
42. "The for you tab is incorrect color as well.  the background should be the black color we're using with a blue line like the screenshot I'm attaching. Your version also attached has a white background behind for you." v0 struggled with this for several iterations. Gave up asking it to fix it.
43. To this point v0 was doing everything in a single component. "Decompose the Navigation, Feed, Tweets, Bottom Navigation, and Messages Button into their own component files."
44. After it decomposed the code I downloaded the zip of the code from v0 added the contents to the repo.
45. Asked claude to analyze the folder and recreate the components into our vibe app. But before I kicked off the command I set up a `nx build vibe --watch` and opened the latest tag for the vibe application and set zephyr to live reload so I could watch the progress.
46. "I've added a folder to our workspace called twitter-clone-v0. This is what we will begin to decompose into microfrontends. This was generated with v0 which uses next and turbopack. We will continue to use Rspack. I want you to recruite the components and styles in apps/vibe. We will not be using Next and will stick with vanilla react. Lets attempt the migration."
47. The first migration got the text there, but the styles were all off. It looks like we forgot to add the styles compilation to Rspack. "It seems the styles are off and all of the colors are missing. We need to add the styles to compile with Rspack."
48. Manually adding the postcss loader `pnpm add -D postcss-loader`. 
49. Styles updated correctly and we got our first decent looking build https://zackary-chapple-2666-shell-vibe-zackarychapple-c9f68fb31-ze.zephyrcloud.app
50. The data is currently hardcoded, asked Claude to make it dynamic "Lets extract all of the data for each of the components and use tanstack query to fetch the data from json objects that we have hardcoded for now. Please review the documentation for tanstack query v5 https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview and extract the data for the components."
51. Removed hardcoded nx-welcome file that is no longer needed. 
52. Added tanstack router. "Now that we are using tanstack query lets add tanstack router. The current page is going to be the root route."
53. I got an error
```bash

    I believe you were following documentation for the old tanstack router, can you update the configuration
```
56. Tanstack router was fixed by claude. 
57. Removed some unused imports in the router.tsx manually. 
58. Asked Claude to create a router mask for the compose modal. "There is a post button in the navigation component. When I click that i want it to use a tanstack router mask of "/compose/post" and open a compose modal component. That component needs a "x" icon in the corner that will close the modal and bring them back to route before the mask. See this for documentation. https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/api/router/RouterOptionsType#routemasks-property"
59. The compose modal wipes the data from the default route. Also noticed that the default route for X is "home". Making this our default too. "The feed component should display when we're on the home route. The default route should be /home. Make this update"
60. Added redirects to home as well as the router mask for the post button. 
61. Manually added module federation for each of the remotes and configured the vibe host
62. Asked claude to help move things to MFEs "we are starting to move to micro frontends with module federation. I need to move the content of the vibe/src/components/feed to be in apps/feed/src/components/feed."
